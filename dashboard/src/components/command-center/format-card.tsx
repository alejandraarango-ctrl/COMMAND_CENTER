/*
 * Format card — one tile per content format inside a CategorySection.
 *
 * Anatomy (top-to-bottom) — matches the refined-terracotta mock:
 *   1. Header row: name + subtitle on the left, HealthPill on the right.
 *   2. Flex spacer pushes the chip row to the bottom of the card so all
 *      cards in a row align their footers regardless of subtitle length.
 *   3. A row of plain text platform chips (no icons, no "Publishes to"
 *      eyebrow).
 *   The surface itself (gradient + warm border + hover lift + left accent
 *   rail) is the shared .cc-surface / .cc-surface--interactive treatment;
 *   there is no top pulse-bar or hover arrow.
 *
 * Click model:
 *   The root is a role="button" <div> with data-action="open-format". When
 *   `format.href` is set, click/Enter/Space navigate via router.push (see
 *   `open()` below). When `href` is absent the card is fully disabled — no
 *   handler, no button role, no focus ring — so AT users aren't told they
 *   can activate something that does nothing. The data-action attribute
 *   is preserved so any future event delegation can still pick up the
 *   card without threading onClick props through every wrapper.
 *
 *   Chips are now non-interactive text spans, so the card root is the
 *   single click target (no nested interactive elements to coordinate).
